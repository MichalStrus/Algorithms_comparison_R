# Machine Learning Algorithms_comparison_R
In this project I implemented three algorithms(decision tree, neural networks and K Nearest Neighbours) to regression, binary classification and multiclass classification problems. I compared algorithms from R libraries with my implementation to check results. I also tested function hyperparameters with cross-validation to find best combination and get best possible outcomes. Every function is included in funckje.R and all function calls are in Glowny.R file.
